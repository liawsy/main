* This is a desktop Expire Date Tracker application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* It is a Java application that hopes to automate and simplify the tracking of soon-to-expire items, mainly intended for students living on campus.
* It is *written in OOP fashion*. It provides a *reasonably well-written* code example that is *significantly bigger* (around 6 KLoC)than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules.
